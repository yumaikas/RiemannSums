##A easy use Reimann Sum calculator

This app is a Reimann Sum calculator. It has been done in collaboration with the work of [NSPostWhenIdle](https://github.com/NSPostWhenIdle/Reimann-Sums), although it hasn't been on github until now. There currently isn't feature paritry between the two apps, this is likely to come with time. 

This app is written in C# 5.0 and as such depends on .Net 4.5 and the corresponding WPF version for the time being (pull requests to change this are welcome.) 

It depends on two major libraries(via Nuget): [YAMP (Yet Another Math Parser)](https://github.com/FlorianRappl/YAMP) and [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI). Many thanks to Paul Betts and FlorianRappl for their work that I've been able to use.
