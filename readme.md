## An easy use Reimann Sum calculator

This app is a Reimann Sum calculator. It has been done in collaboration with the work of [NSPostWhenIdle](https://github.com/NSPostWhenIdle/Reimann-Sums), although it hasn't been on github until now. The apps aren't identical, but serve the same purpose. 

This app is written in C# 5.0 and as such depends on .Net 4.5 and the corresponding WPF version for the time being (pull requests to change this are welcome.) 

It depends on two major libraries (via Nuget): [YAMP (Yet Another Math Parser)](https://github.com/FlorianRappl/YAMP) and [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI). Many thanks to Paul Betts and FlorianRappl for their work that I've been able to use.
